        Hi my name is Kumiko. I currently work as an accountant. It's hard work but I do enjoy the analytical aspect of it. One of the best feelings is able to
        figure out a complex financial puzzle. Some of my favorite hobbies are exercising, reading, cooking, playing music, and traveling. When it comes to exercising I like to
        run, swim, play basketball, and more. As long as it's a challenge, it's something I enjoy. Reading has been a passion of mine since youth. Some of my favorite books include
        Oliver Twist, The Great Gatsby, and 1984. I love the classics, but also any good mystery or fantasy book. Music has been a part of my life since I was little.
        I started playing piano when I was six years old and my fond of music grew from that. Lastly, traveling is one my favorite things to do. I love experiencing new cultures, food,
        people, and historic landmarks.
        
        Professionally, I hope to eventually run my own business. I've always had the entrepreneur bug in me. As of now though, it would be nice to grow to a senior position in a company. I'd like to
        obtain my MBA to further my education in the world of business. Another goal of mine is to contribute and help out with causes close to my heart when I reach a certain level of success.
